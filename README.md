# CivitAI in React Native
A silly little app that uses the CivitAI API. I made this during my vacation week as an exercise and a break from my main project (Goraku).

## Current State
I am still finishing up the model stack and creator stack. I will be releasing the apk and tidying up the readme once I get these finished!

The CivitAI API is simple, so theres not much work to be done. The API doesn't have any auth endpoints (a bummer) so everything is pretty straight forward.

## Future Plans
Basically, just adding any future CivitAI endpoints.

I do think it would be cool to remotely download models to your local PC using this app. This could be done through an auto1111 webui extension or a seperate server. If anyone knows of something like this or have any ideas, please let me know.

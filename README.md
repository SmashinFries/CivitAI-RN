# CivitAI in React Native
A silly little app that uses the CivitAI API.

## To-do
- [ ] Finish adding data
- [ ] Model filtering
- [ ] Image filtering
- [ ] Creator pages
- [ ] NSFW and Theme settings

## Current State
First Release is out now. Its very basic and is missing a lot - but its a start!

## Future Plans
Basically, just adding any future CivitAI endpoints.

I do think it would be cool to remotely download models to your PC using this app. This could be done through an auto1111 webui extension or a seperate server. If anyone knows of something like this or have any ideas, please let me know.
